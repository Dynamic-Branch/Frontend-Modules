How to start the app

- clone the repo using git clone
- cd frontend-modules (to open the project's folder)
- run "npm install" in the terminal to install node_modules
- run "npm run dev" to start the app
- ctrl+click on the link to open the app in the browser (http://localhost:5137/)

If you receive the ENOENT error, it is a location issue. 
Make sure to close VSCode and reopen it in the folder called frontend-modules.
