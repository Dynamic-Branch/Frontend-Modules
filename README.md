**How to start the app**

- Clone the repo using `git clone`
- cd frontend-modules (to open the project's folder)
- Run `npm install` in the terminal to install node_modules
- Run `npm run dev` to start the app
- ctrl+click on the link to open the app in the browser (http://localhost:5137/)

If you receive the `ENOENT` error, it means there's a location issue. 
Make sure to close VSCode and reopen it in the folder called frontend-modules. 

**Until the final routing of the components, they are split on different branches based on their JIRA stories as following:**
 - `SCRUM-1` - the Sidebar
 - `SCRUM-2` - the Signature Pad
 - `SCRUM-3` - the Calendar/Scheduler

Repeat the `npm run dev` command for each branch to execute.
